    <div>
        <p>
            I am Vietnamese-American. I came to the US in 2008 and lived here for 14 years as a permanent resident until I became a US citizen in February of 2022.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am the oldest of 4. I have a younger sister who attends the University of Washington and my two little brothers are still in middle school. One of my favorite vacations we went on was going to the ruins of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.
