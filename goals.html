        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>After graduating college, my goal is get a job as a software development in a big city. Ideally, I would be a part of a team that is creating a product that is beneficially to society, but I'm willing to overlook that for a big enough salary.</p>
        <p>Some cities I would like to work in is New York City, San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, or Houston. I could also see myself working internationally as well. Places like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul">Seoul</a> would also be great.</p>
