        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>I first got into programming as a sophomore in high school when I first took a python class. I instantly fell in love and knew what I wantd to do in the future. There was something exilhirating about debugging code and everything you made came diretly from your brain. It kinda gave me a god complex for a short bit of time but I quickly got over that. What I like most about programming is just the ability to make things that are useful in my everyday life.</p>

        <h2>Anime</h2>
        <p>Over the pandemic, I got really into anime. Some of my favorites are Mob Psycho 100, One Piece, Vinland Saga, and Attack on Titan. The animation and story of these anime really captivated me.</p>
